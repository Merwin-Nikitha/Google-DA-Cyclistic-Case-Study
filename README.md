# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: Converting Casual Riders to Annual Members

## Project Overview

This project is the Capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. As a Junior Data Analyst for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, the goal was to analyze 12 months of historical bike trip data from 2021 to understand the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The ultimate objective is to inform marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Tools Used

* **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Microsoft Excel (specifically Power Query for efficient ETL processes)
* **Data Visualization & Analysis:** Tableau Desktop

## Key Findings

* **Casual riders consistently take significantly longer trips**, with their usage peaking sharply on weekends, indicating leisure-oriented use.
* **Annual members demonstrate consistent, high ride frequency throughout weekdays**, suggesting commuting or regular errand-based travel.
* Both user types exhibit a strong preference for **Classic and Electric bikes**, while **Docked bikes show notably lower utilization**.

## Recommendations for Membership Growth

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended:

1.  **Implement a Ride-Time Based Loyalty Program:** Develop a program where both casual and annual riders earn points based on accumulated ride time, redeemable for benefits like membership discounts for casual riders and premium perks for annual members.
2.  **Drive Weekday Engagement Among Casual Riders:** Introduce specific discounts and promotional campaigns (e.g., 'Weekday Commuter Pass') to encourage casual riders to use bikes more during weekdays, broadening their usage habits.
3.  **Enhance Utilization of Docked Bikes:** Implement targeted pricing strategies and awareness campaigns to incentivize both casual and annual members to use docked bikes more frequently, optimizing the usage of existing assets.
